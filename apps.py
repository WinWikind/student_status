            1. High Dropout Rate (32.12%)

            Students with scholarships have a higher graduation rate compared to those without scholarships.
            
            2. Large Number of Displaced Students (54.84%)

            Additional support, both financial and academic, is needed to improve their retention.
            
            3. Financial Issues Affect Academic Status

            Students with academic debt are more vulnerable to dropping out compared to those without debt.
            
            4. Some Study Programs Have High Dropout Rates

            Nursing and Management programs have a significant dropout rate.
            Study programs with a small number of students need to be evaluated to enhance their appeal.

                    Focus on students at risk of dropping out based on their financial status.
                2. Flexible Payment Options

                    Provide installment payment plans with 0% interest or partial debt/tuition forgiveness programs for high-achieving students.
                3. Gap Year Program with Academic Support

                    Offer a structured gap year program with special orientation for returning students to help them adjust to changes in the environment, technology, or curriculum.
                4. Academic Guidance for Students with Low Grades

                    Additional learning programs for students with low admission scores, especially for older and married students.
                5. Psychological & Counseling Support

                    Establish a psychological support and academic counseling center for students experiencing financial or academic stress.
                6. Monitoring and Predicting Dropouts

                    Conduct further review and monitoring of currently enrolled students.
                    Utilize machine learning technology to predict dropout risks, enabling early intervention.
